<p align="justify" class="style4">Control is an <em>applied </em>science. Control 
theorists have developed an impressive amount of sophisticated control methodologies 
under all kinds of different assumptions. These assumptions are hardly ever all 
satisfied in practice. Therefore control practitioners face the problem of selecting 
an appropriate control system design methodology which is not an entirely scientific 
or mathematical issue. An interesting line of research is to investigate to what 
extent science and mathematics can help and how to bridge the remaining gap. A first 
attempt in this direction has been published [L.G. Van Willigenburg et al. Proceedings 
IFAC World Congres, Prague, 3-8 July, 2005,

<b><p class="style3"><a name="PHYSICS"></a><b>Understanding physics: Short 
introduction</b>
<p align="justify" class="style4">Many people tell you not to even try to 
understand physics, especially Einstein’s relativity and most of all quantum 
theory. Even among physicists themselves the advice not to try to understand 
quantum theory is heard. The good news is that it is actually quite simple to 
understand both! To see this it is necessary to cut of the mask of both 
relativity and quantum theory. Both are not entirely without error and these 
errors have obscured what can now be simply understood. From an appropriate 
inspection of the history of relativity and quantum theory modifications of both 
are proposed. Also by inspection of the literature part of these modifications 
can be found, but only separately. When combined these provide a conceptually 
very simple model of physics that is largely equivalent to acoustic waves moving 
in air [<a href="#drieenzestig">63</a>], [<a href="#negenenzestig">69</a>], [<a href="#eenenzeventig">71</a>], [<a href="#zevenenzeventig">77</a>], [<a href="#S2022-1">S2022-1</a>].

<p align="justify" class="style4">Early 2021 Willem de Koning and I were contacted 
by Andrew Laidlaw who spotted our publications. He had been investigating the 
fundamentals of physics for most of his life which resulted in a number of 
publications that have a lot in common with ours since they are also based on a 
wave structure of matter with waves propagating at light speed c (called luminal waves by Andrew Laidlaw) and 
independence of time and three dimensional space (called 3D+t by him). Andrew Laidlaw captured all his results in a 
book entitled <a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/AfterPhysics.pdf" target="_blank">After Physics</a> which 
is impressive since 
he manages to connect the wave structure of matter with the mathematics of both 
relativity and quantum theory. We believe this provides the missing 
link between these two theories that main-stream physics considers to be one of 
the most prominent problems. The wave structure of matter turns 
physics into a proper science again, free from mysteries, paradoxes and 
fairy tales.</p></b>

<p align="justify" class="style4">Combining the ideas and results of [<a href="#drieenzestig">63</a>], [<a href="#negenenzestig">69</a>]
with results published in the book <a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/AfterPhysics.pdf" target="_blank">After Physics</a> 
by Andrew Laidlaw, has led to a publication in which Andrew Laidlaw and I 
further expose what he calls &quot;the greatest mistake in physics&quot;&nbsp;in his book. This paper may be considered "an answer to Newton and Bell" concerning the appearance of Action at a Distance
[<a href="#S2022-1">S2022-1</a>]. In a second paper combining these results, three delusions 
are identified obscuring the understanding and connection of quantum theory, relativity and gravity
[<a href="#zevenenzeventig">77</a>].

</b><p align="justify" class="style4">In building models physicists often presume systems to be in equilibrium. 
Although generally for very good reasons the equilibrium assumptions and their justification 
may sometimes lead to erroneous models or unprovable mathematical requirements. 
A good example is the equilibrium assumptions that underly statistical mechanics 
and thermodynamics. In our opinion statistical mechanics, and in fact any type of 
statistical modeling, is a &quot;last resort&quot; if no a-priori knowledge or insight is 
available. Starting from very simple linear dynamics at the micro-scale of physical 
systems we showed how the second law of thermodynamics emerges from them. No statistical 
mechanics or equilibrium conditions are needed to obtain this result [<a href="#achtenveertig">48]</a>.<p class="style3"><a name="PTOP"></a><b>Understanding physics: Subjects </b><br></p>

	</b></p>
	<p align="justify" class="style4">For non-linear systems digital optimal controllers are synthesized 
that explicitly take into account the inter-sample (continuous-time) behaviour of 
the controlled system, the digital nature of the controller, and the way in which 
the system is sampled. Synchronous (conventional), <em>asynchronous </em>and <em>random 
	</em>sampling schemes are considered [</a><a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kalman-rudolf-emil" target="_blank">R.E. 
Kalman</a> and J.E. Bertram, 1959, &quot;A unified approach to the theory of sampling 
systems&quot;,
	<a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/KalBer59.pdf" target="_blank">Journal 
of the Franklin Institute, 67, 405-436 </a>]. Based on an accurate mathematical 
	model of the system and a mathematical criterion describing the control 
	objectives, a digital optimal control sequence and a digital optimal LQG 
	compensator realizing feedback are computed off-line. Both the digital 
	optimal control sequence and the digital optimal LQG 
compensator are stored in the controller memory. The only on-line computations that 
need to be performed by the controller are a small number of matrix vector multiplications 
to compute control corrections from the on-line measured data. This type of control 
of non-linear systems is approximately optimal if the model structure and its parameter 
values are well established and if the remaining uncertainty is small [M. Athans, 
1971, &quot;The role and use of the stochastic Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian problem in control 
system design&quot;, <a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/Athans.pdf">IEEE Trans. 
Aut. Contr., AC-16(6), 529-552</a> ]. If the model structure is well established 
but some of the parameter values are not, and the on-line data contain information 
regarding these parameter values, actively adaptive controllers are required. As 
opposed to other (passively) adaptive controllers, actively adaptive controllers 
take into account the need to identify the parameters in selecting the control [Y. 
Bar-Shalom, 1981, &quot;Stochastic dynamic programming: Caution and probing&quot;,
	<a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/bshcb.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Trans. 
Aut. Contr., AC-26(5), 1184-1195 </a>]. Since most of our research regarding digital 
optimal control and LQG compensation of non-linear systems has been completed actively 
(dual) adaptive controllers have become a new subject of our research [L.G. Van

	<p class="style3"><a name="STRALG"></a><b>Highly efficient algorithms to 
establish structural properties of large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems</b>
	<p align="justify" class="style4">It is generally believed that the analysis of 
nonlinear dynamic systems is very much more complicated than the analysis of 
linear dynamic systems. The determination of three fundamental structural 
properties of nonlinear dynamic systems, being local structural identifiability, 
local controllability and local observability, turns out to be as easy as those 
for linear systems. This remarkable result is obtained by analyzing structural 
properties through sensitivities as first discovered by my former room mate and 
current colleague Hans Stigter. These sensitivities are governed by linear 
time-varying dynamics. As a result the analysis and computations only require 
application of results from linear systems theory. Actually, the algorithms 
based on sensitivities even outperform common ones for linear systems, that are 
not based on sensitivities. This makes them highly suitable for large-scale 
linear and nonlinear dynamic systems [<a href="#zevenenzestig">67]</a>, [<a href="#vierenzeventig">74]</a>,

	<p class="style3"><a name="TLS"></a><b>Temporal linear system structure</b></a></p>
	<p align="justify" a name="TLS" class="style4"></a>LQG perturbation feedback controllers for non-linear systems are 
often based on the linearised dynamics about optimal control and state trajectories. 
These linearised dynamics constitute a time-varying linear system that may be
	<em>temporarily </em>uncontrollable or <em>temporarily </em>unreconstructable. This 
highly relevant information for the LQG feedback controller design is not detected 
by any of the four conventional Kalman decompositions. Temporal uncontrollability 
is associated to differential controllability in continuous-time and to N-step controllability 
is discrete-time. The description and detection of temporal uncontrollability and 
temporal unreconstructability in both continuous and discrete time requires the 
introduction of systems with time-varying (state) dimensions. These type of systems 
moreover enable a well rounded realization theory for time-varying linear systems 
as already suggested by Kalman in 1969. The description of systems with time-varying 
dimensions in combination with suitable Kalman decompositions does enable the description 
and detection of temporal uncontrollability and temporal unreconstructability [<a href="#drieenveertig">43</a><a name="TLS">], 
[</a><a href="#vijfenveertig">45</a><a name="TLS">]</a>, [<a href="#zevenenveertig">47</a><a name="TLS">]</a>.

They determine whether temporal uncontrollability and temporal unreconstructability 
cause temporal instability of the closed loop system.<br><p class="style3"><a name="ASYNC"></a><b>Asynchronous and aperiodically sampled digital

sampling if some measurements are cheap and some are expensive. Asynchronous and

to reduce the influence of intelligent disturbances, or to increase stabilizability.

optimality conditions and the minimality of the compensator. Based on these equations 
numerical algorithms have been developed to compute optimal reduced-order LQG compensators

<p class="style5"><a name="AARCH"></a>Actively (dual) adaptive receding horizon 
controllers</p>
<p align="justify" a name="RECHOR" class="style4"></a>Digital optimal control and LQG compensation of non-linear 
systems is approximately optimal only if the model structure and its parameter values 
are well established and if the remaining uncertainty is small and may be represented 
by small additive white noise. If the model structure is well established but some 
of the parameter values are not, while the on-line data contain information regarding 
these parameter values, actively adaptive controllers are required. As opposed to 
other (passively) adaptive controllers, actively adaptive controllers take into 
account the need to identify the parameters in selecting the control [Y. Bar-Shalom, 
1981, &quot;Stochastic dynamic programming: Caution and probing&quot;,
<a href="http://gvw007.yolasite.com/resources/bshcb.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Trans. 
Aut. Contr., AC-26(5), 1184-1195 </a>]
<p align="justify" class="style4">Based on an extensive literature search an actively adaptive 
digital controller structure has been developed which involves a least squares parameter 
estimator and a receding horizon optimal controller. Besides being actively adaptive 
the advantage of this structure is that it consists of two well established parts 
in the control literature being the least squares parameter estimator and the receding 
horizon optimal controller. Due to the receding horizon optimal controller this 
structure computes a reasonably accurate &quot;cost to go&quot; and due to the least squares 
parameter estimator it exploits fully all the currently collected data to estimate 
the uncertain parameters. A disadvantage is that this controller structure is computationally 
expensive, both in real-time and in simulation. In real-time this problem can be 
relaxed by selecting larger sampling periods which does not pose a problem since 
our digital controller design procedure explicitly considers the inter-sample behaviour. 
The current application areas are greenhouse climate control and the control of 
drying and sterilization processes where initially some of the model parameters 
are not very well known. Related publication: [<a href="#veertig">40</a>] </p>

<p class="style5"><a name="minreal"></a>Minimal realization of time-varying systems 
with time-varying dimensions</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">The minimality of discrete-time linear time-varying systems 
is fundamental to optimal digital reduced-order LQG controller synthesis. From the 
associated LQG theory minimal realizations with time-varying dimensions emerge &quot;automatically&quot;. 
The associated realization theory however does not consider the influence of non-zero 
initial conditions, while the initial condition of the optimal LQG controller is 
usually non-zero. In [<a href="#vijfentwintig">25</a>], [<a href="#dertig">30</a>] 
the minimality property is generalized for systems with non-zero initial conditions. 
After this generalization minimality is no longer equivalent with reachability together 
with observability but with weak (modified) reachability together with observability. 
Weak reachability is a weaker property than reachability and both properties rely 
partly on an empty matrix concept. For empty initial conditions weak reachability 
and reachability become identical [<a href="#vierenveerig">44</a>], [<a href="#zesenveertig">46</a>].
<p align="justify" class="style4">When designing perturbation feedback controllers for non-linear 
systems based on linearized dynamics the linearized dynamics may be temporarily 
uncontrollable/unreconstructable [<a href="#een">1</a>]. To detect this as well 
as to obtain a satisfactory realization theory for time-varying continuous-time 
systems piecewise constant rank systems are introduced. They constitute continuous-time 
systems with time-varying dimensions. In combination with a Kalman decomposition 
based on differential controllability and differential reconstructability they enable 
the description and detection of temporal system structure as well as temporal uncontrollability 
and/or unreconstructability [<a href="#drieenveertig">43</a>], [<a href="#vijfenveertig">45</a>],

<p class="style3"><a name="CURQT"></a><strong>Connecting and unmasking relativity and quantum theory</strong></a></strong></p>
<p align="justify" class="style4">Many people tell you not to even try to understand physics, 
especially Einstein’s relativity and most of all quantum theory. Even among 
physicists themselves the advice not to try to understand quantum theory is 
heard. The good news is that it is actually quite simple to understand both! To 
see this it is necessary to cut of the mask of both relativity and quantum 
theory. Both are not entirely without error and these errors have obscured what 
can now be simply understood. From an appropriate inspection of the history of 
relativity and quantum theory modifications of both are proposed. 
Also by inspection of the literature part of these modifications can be found, 
but only separately. When combined these provide a conceptually very 
simple model of physics that is largely equivalent to acoustic waves moving in 
air. Particles do not exist, they are local manifestations of scalar standing 
wave structures so matter has a wave structure (WSM: wave structure of 
matter) immediately explaining wave-particle duality. At the very bottom of this 
simple model describing wave propagation lies a computational difficulty. That 
probably explains why all kinds of approximate models have been proposed 
providing excellent quantitative agreement with related experiments but also 
leading to many 
paradoxes as it comes to <em>understanding</em> fundamental physics. Although the 
understanding of fundamental physics through our proposed model becomes easy the 
challenge shifts towards explaining how all known physics emerges from this 
simple model. Wave interference, wave modulation, and the Doppler effect will be 
prominent parts of these explanations. Three papers describing these ideas and 
results have been published [<a href="#drieenzestig">63</a>], [<a href="#negenenzestig">69</a>], [<a href="#eenenzeventig">71</a>], [<a href="#zevenenzeventig">77</a>].

he calls &quot;the greatest mistake in physics&quot;&nbsp;in his book. 
This paper may be considered &quot;an answer to Newton and Bell&quot; concerning the 
appearance of Action at a Distance [<a href="#S2022-1">S2022-1</a>]. In a second paper combining these results, three delusions 
are identified obscuring the understanding and connection of quantum theory, relativity and gravity
